Advanced Photo Editor

A powerful, free, and open-source photo editing application built with modern web technologies. This project aims to provide a robust, user-friendly alternative to professional photo editing software, accessible directly in the browser.

Overview

Advanced Photo Editor is a feature-rich, browser-based photo editing tool designed to offer a Photoshop-like experience. It allows users to upload images and apply various filters and transformations with an intuitive interface. Currently, the application is entirely frontend-based, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the Canvas API) to deliver real-time image manipulation.

Features





Image Upload: Upload images directly from your device.



Filters: Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, blur, sepia, grayscale, invert, and opacity using sliders for precise control.



Transformations: Rotate images (left/right) and flip them horizontally or vertically.



Real-Time Preview: Instantly see the effects of applied filters and transformations.



Download: Save edited images as PNG files.



Responsive UI: Sleek, modern design with a gradient background and animated transitions, optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

Current Status

The application is currently a frontend-only project, built with:





HTML5 for structure



CSS3 with animations and Tailwind-inspired styling



JavaScript with the Canvas API for image processing



Roboto font for a clean, professional look

Future Plans

The goal is to make Advanced Photo Editor a complete, free, and open-source photo editing application. Planned enhancements include:





Backend Integration: Adding a backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, or similar) to support:





Image storage and management



Advanced image processing (e.g., AI-based enhancements, batch editing)



User accounts and cloud-based project saving



Additional Features:





Layers and compositing



Advanced tools (e.g., crop, resize, text overlay, brushes)



Undo/redo functionality



Support for more file formats (e.g., JPEG, WEBP)



Performance Optimizations: Improve processing speed for large images



Community Contributions: Encourage open-source contributions to expand features and improve accessibility
