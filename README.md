  - Advanced image processing (e.g., AI-based enhancements, batch editing)  
  - User accounts and cloud-based project saving  

- **Additional Features**:  
  - Layers and compositing  
  - Advanced tools (e.g., crop, resize, text overlay, brushes)  
  - Undo/redo functionality  
  - Support for more file formats (e.g., JPEG, WEBP)  

- **Performance Optimizations**: Improve processing speed for large images  
- **Community Contributions**: Encourage open-source contributions to expand features and improve accessibility
